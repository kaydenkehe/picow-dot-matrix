### **INFO:**<br/>
All you have to do is plug the project in and send GET requests to it using the format in send_req.py <br/>
The print files here aren't the same as in the video; the ones here allow you to set the project on a flat surface. <br/> 
A possible improvement to this project would be using POST requests and including the message in the body. I'm kind of lazy, though! <br/>
Probably the majority of the code here isn't my own, but I'm including it in this repo in case the developers decide to change their code. <br/> <br/>
